Want to submit your article?
============================

We currently accept article submissions via Github pull requests as that is how our site is hosted. Fork our repository at 
https://github.com/deadbeefnews/deadbeefnews.github.io/ add a post and then submit a pull request to us. You can find more information on adding posts with Jekyll on their website http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/

While we're fairly lenient on article quality, if we end up getting a lot of submissions, we may have to do some currating. Thanks to all our submitters!
