Today, the University of Stanford in California released a study confirming what has already been a well accepted fact. The drivers of California are worse at merging than the Subversion (SVN) version control system. We spoke with some drivers in California to ask them their thoughts on the matter.

“You can only branch out into traffic so many times.” Said Robert Swamp of San Diego. “You think you’re just trying to checkout the view, and soon enough, you crash into a tree!”

Lester Winston of Los Angeles had a similar attitude. “You just want to merge in, and the other guy just wants to fast forward his middle pointer!”
