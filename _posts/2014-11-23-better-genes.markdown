San Francisco, California. When Kevin and Emily Smith got married a few years ago, starting a family was out of the picture. "Since Kevin was hit hard with the ugly stick, we weren't sure it'd be the responsible thing to do," says Emily. "Yeah, our friends' kids are *really* cute, which makes their Instragram feeds just incredible," adds Kevin.

This all remained true until they learned about Jack Ballmer's newest startup, Better Genes. "We wanted to disrupt the family planning industry. Gone are the days of worrying about whether you have enough income for a family, or whether or not you're actually a decent human being that should be raising kids at all. It all comes down to thisâ€“Will you be able to keep up with the other families on Instagram? And the first step to that is a cute kid," explains Ballmer.

The Smiths are now in stage one of the Better Genes' DNA mutation process, which has about a .001% success rate. Ballmer adds, "When things go wrong, we usually end up with a baby that has some ungodly super power, so we end up taking them to a remote part of Russia and leaving them there." He was advised by his lawyers not to further discuss this matter.

"I'm just looking forward to not always posting food or poolside selfies anymore," says Emily. With a miracle, that just may happen.
