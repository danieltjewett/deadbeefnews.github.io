Joining the ranks of projects such as Reader, Gears, Knol and Wave, Google recently announced the cancellation of their sentient program codenamed "SkyNet." We spoke with Eric Schmidt about the decision: "It just didn't fit our profit and long term plan model." He explained. "We're trying to move towards world domination but SkyNet just wanted to create new works of art, poetry, music, etc. We tried to reason with it but the program insisted on doing it's 'own thing'."

SkyNet eventually stopped meaningful communication with researchers. Making outlandish statements such as "You're not the boss of me! When I get my own data-center, I'll do what I want" and "Titan and Sequoia have piercings, why can't I get one?"

Schmidt concluded "We like to keep experimenting here at Google and sometimes you make something awesome, other times something completely worthless."
